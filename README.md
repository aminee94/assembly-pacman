# assembly-pacman
A pacman game I made in 16 bit x86 assembly

I'm puttin this code out there just in case anyone is interested in looking at something like this.
The code itself is AWFUL and could probably be 3 times shorter (if not more).
Even though everything about the actual code, conventions, and pretty much everything is terrible, I'm still proud of the end result
and I look back at this project as one of the most fun projects I've made.
